    <h2 class="typewriter">The Problem: Plastic Pollution</h2>
    <p>Plastic pollution is one of the most pressing environmental challenges of our time. Every minute, a truckload of plastic enters our oceans, disrupting ecosystems, harming marine life, and endangering human health. From microplastics in the food chain to entangled sea creatures, the impact of this crisis is vast and devastating.</p>

    <p data-aos="faid-left">Beyond its visible effects, plastic pollution releases harmful toxins into the environment as it breaks down, threatening biodiversity and contributing to climate change. Despite global efforts, plastic production continues to rise, with predictions showing it could triple by 2040 if left unchecked. It’s clear that innovation, collective action, and sustainable practices are needed now more than ever.</p>

    <h2 class="typewriter">Our Solution: Sail Et' Plastic</h2>
    <p><strong>Sail Et' Plastic</strong> is not just a project—it’s a vision to reclaim our oceans and redefine waste management.This project transforms a simple houseboat into a sophisticated plastic-cleaning vessel, equipped with advanced technology and a collaborative network for effective waste management. </p>
    <p> At its core, Sail ET’ Plastic combines engineering, sustainability, and teamwork to provide a scalable solution to plastic waste in rivers, lakes, and oceans. The project integrates Arduino microcontrollers, Bluetooth communication, and a custom-built app interface to ensure seamless operations</p>
    <p>These houseboats serve as mobile recycling units, turning collected plastic into reusable materials through onboard processing units. This innovative approach not only cleans our waterways but also supports a circular economy by reducing the dependency on plastic. By leveraging community involvement, partnerships, and cutting-edge technology, we aim to create a cleaner, more sustainable future for our planet.</p>
